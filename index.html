  <p> &nbsp; Manifesto 2027 </p>
  <hr>
<p> Dear Citizens of the Netherlands and the whole world.<br>
We are hackers, we are activists, we are international, we are group 27.
We are concerned with and appalled by the current developments of society.
Take attention, listen carefully to us, you are in need for.</p>
<p>I &nbsp; Your life is your private property. International corporations in collaboration with governments of democratic states suppress citizens self-determination. They do this by gathering
data, enabling and strengthening their capital and power. More and more devices and processes of current daily life generate data material, which is forwarded to enterprises and government authorities. Public space has long been under surveillance by intelligence agencies, but they have long penetrated deep, too deep into the private sphere. They hear what you say, they see what you write, they track where you are, they know what programs you watch, which websites you visit, what products you buy and they know more than you do. </p>
<p>II &nbsp; There is no justification to monitor anyone without reason.</p>
<p>III &nbsp; Data must not be a commodity of trade.</p>
<p>IV &nbsp; Governments must not exchange their informations with companies. Established as post-World War II national organizations for stability and security, the intelligence agencies formed a global network of surveillance and repression. It resulted in a supra-national system of unimaginable and uncontrollable possibilities in the hands of organizations beyond the law. By
integrating global technology companies, they not only gained access to all information, they also gained control over the all-pervasive infrastructure of todayâ€˜s world. Public transport, electric power stations, water supply, weapons systems, supervised by artificial intelligence, everything is part of this global control network.</p>
<p>V &nbsp; Information involves power. Power demands responsibility. Technical developments, digitization and automation have made people obsolete in many areas, removing all direct human-control. The amount of data has taken on unimaginable proportions and the externalized control processes have created a system of tremendous scale and uncontrollable power.</p>
<p>VI &nbsp;  Centralized information must be secure, at any time, at any place, without exception. The international monitoring network have long since lost control of their own system. A radical lack of control of data and its implementation has infested this system, the constant abuse of power of centralized information undermines its integrity. But what would happens if this power ends up in the wrong hands?</p>
<p>VII &nbsp; Humans should not be replaced by machines in security relevant processes.</p>
<p>VIII &nbsp; Control units of infrastructure and national as well as global
security relevant facilities must not be connected to networks.</p>
<p>IX &nbsp; People should take responsibility for their own actions.</p>
<p>X &nbsp; People must act according to their convictions in the spirit of the long and hard won achievements of ethical principles. After this day, the world will not be the same again. It is time to open the eyes of mankind. Corporate groups and governments will soon be aware of their shortcomings and have to take the first steps of responsibility. Exit the system, take the path of enlightenment and take responsibility for your actions and call for power over your own life. Now, is the time.</p>
